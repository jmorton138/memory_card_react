# About

This project is an assignment from The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Javascript Course. The assignment was to use React functional components and hooks to build a memory game.

I decided to base mine around Chinese flashcards since learning Chinese is a hobby of mine.

# How to play

The goal is to click each card only once in a sequence. Each time you click a new card, your score increments. If you click the same card twice, the game resets, setting your score back to zero, but saving your top score.

After each click, the cards are shuffled. If you surpass your previous highest score, the "Best score" field increments.

Once you click through all 12 cards, you get an alert that you've one.
